# Assemblyline 4 - Service Base

This repository provides the base service functionality for Assemblyline 4 services.

## Creating a new Assemblyline service

### Service file structure

An Assemblyline service has the following file structure:

```text
assemblyline-service-<service name>
│
├── Dockerfile
├── <service name>.py
└── service_manifest.yml
```

This is overview of what each of these does:

- `Dockerfile` ─ Build file for the service container, see _Dockerfile_ section below for more details
- `<service name>.py` ─ Contains main service code
- `service_manifest.yml` ─ Service definition file, see _Service manifest_ section below for more details


### Service manifest

Every service must have a `service_manifest.yml` file in its root directory. The manifest file presents essential information about the service to the Assemblyline core system, information the system must have before it can run the service.

The diagram below shows all the elements that the manifest file can contain, including a brief description of each.

```yaml
# Name of the service
name: ResultSample
# Version of the service
version: 1
# Description of the service
description: >
  ALv4 Result example service

  This service provides examples of how to:
     - define your service manifest
     - use the different section types
     - use tags
     - use heuristics to score sections
     - use the att&ck matrix
     - use the updater framework
     - define submission parameters
     - define service configuration parameters

# Regex defining the types of files the service accepts and rejects
accepts: .*
rejects: empty|metadata/.*

# At which stage the service should run (one of: FILTER, EXTRACT, CORE, SECONDARY, POST)
# NOTE: Stages are executed in the order defined in the list
stage: CORE
# Which category the service is part of (one of: Antivirus, Dynamic Analysis, External, Extraction, Filtering, Networking, Static Analysis)
category: Static Analysis

# Does the service require access to the file to perform its task
# If set to false, the service will only have access to the file metadata (e.g. Hashes, size, type, ...)

# (only use for service that will always provided different results each run)

#                          that the user can change about the service for each of its scans

    value: false

```

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is required to build the service container that will be executed in the system.

The following items must be set for all services:

- All services must be based on the `cccs/assemblyline-v4-service-base:latest` image
- An environment variable must be set for the service path
- Install any service requirements
- Copy the service code into `/opt/al/al_service/`

```dockerfile
FROM cccs/assemblyline-v4-service-base:latest

# Set the service path
ENV SERVICE_PATH result_sample.ResultSample

# By default, the base service container as the assemblyline user as the running user
#  switch to root to perform installation of dependancies
USER root

# See that we all these operations in one line to reduce
#  the number of container layers and size of the container
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y my_debian_apt_dependency_package && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --user my_pip_dependency && rm -rf ~/.cache/pip

# Change to the assemblyline user to make sure your service does not run as root
USER assemblyline

# Copy the service code in the service directory
WORKDIR /opt/al_service
COPY assemblyline_result_sample_service .
```

## Testing an Assemblyline service

To test an Assemblyline service in standalone mode, the [run_service_once.py](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-v4-service/src/master/dev/run_service_once.py) script can be used to run a single task through the service for testing. That script does not require that you have a working version of Assemblyline installed, all you need are the Assemblyline python libraries.

### Setting up dev environment

**NOTE:** The following environment setup has only been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.

1. Install required packages

    ```
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libffi-dev python3.7 python3.7-dev python3-pip automake autoconf libtool
    ```

2. Install Assemblyline v4 service package

    ```
    pip install --no-cache-dir --user assemblyline-v4-service
    ```

3. Add your service development directory path (ie. `/home/ubuntu/assemblyline-v4-service`) to the PYTHONPATH environment variable

### Using the `run_service_once.py` script

#### Steps

1. Ensure the current working directory is the root of the service directory of the service to be run

   ```shell
   cd assemblyline-service-<service name>
   ```

2. From a terminal, run the `run_service_once` script, where `<service path>` is the path to the service module and `<file path>` is the path of the file to be processed

   ```shell
   python3.11 -m assemblyline_v4_service.dev.run_service_once <service path> <file path>
   ```


3. The output of the service (`result.json` and extracted/supplementary files) will be located in a directory where the input file is located

#### Example of running the ResultSample service

1. Change working directory to root of the service:

   ```shell
   cd assemblyline_result_sample_service
   ```

2. From a terminal, run the `run_service_once` script

   ```shell
   python3.11 -m assemblyline_v4_service.dev.run_service_once assemblyline_result_sample_service.result_sample.ResultSample /home/ubuntu/testfile.doc
   ```

3. The `results.json` and any extracted/supplementary files will be outputted to `/home/ubuntu/testfile_resultsample`
