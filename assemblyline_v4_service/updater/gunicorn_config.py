The updater components get all the same environment variables as other core containers.
If these variables are set globally for ui and you don't want it to effect the updaters
they can be overwritten (for all future systems) by setting them in the service manifest
entry for the updater container, or (for a running system) in the service configuration
UI panel for the update container.
